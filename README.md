# world-citizen
World citizen is a humanitarian organisation, whose aim is to create a cloth donation platform where anyone can donate clothes. This project idea is from a design task during my UI/UX design training at Zuri. The design was created by me, and it is developed using Bootstrap CSS Framework.
